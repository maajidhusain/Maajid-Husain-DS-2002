After that, you’ll use that data source to create a simple chatbot which allows the user to as a variety of questions to the chatbot. You DO NOT need to make this bot run in Discord or Twitter, but rather at the local machine.\n","\n"," Your bot will need to answer the questions (taking note to use various forms of ways to ask the question)in a human type of form.\n"," - What were the top 5 shows on Netflix 2 years ago? Show me the top 5 shows on Netflix 2 years ago. Show me the top 5 shows on Netflix two years ago.\n"," - What was the top movie on Netflix in 2020?\n"," - How long was the best movie on Netflix last year? What was the release year of that movie?\n","\n"," These are just *sample* questions. You need to allow you bot to ask 10 different categories/types of questions. They are up to you on which questions, but the bot needs to tell the user what those question categories that it can answer. Like: Top movies by year, top X movies / shows by year. Genre of Movie/Show of the top Movie/Show...# of seasons of top shows...etc. Star(s) of the top show/movie. You’ll need to use the user response to form a query for your Mongo Dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" ## My plan\n"," 1.
