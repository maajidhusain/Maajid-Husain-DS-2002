    "# Creating a Chatbot to ask questions about Movies\n",
    "You will use Netflix TV Shows and Movies data to create an ETL process to Extract, Transform and Load multiple datasets from CVS Files into a MongoDB Database. After that, you’ll use that data source to create a simple chatbot which allows the user to as a variety of questions to the chatbot. You DO NOT need to make this bot run in Discord or Twitter, but rather at the local machine.\n",
    " \n",
    "Your bot will need to answer the questions (taking note to use various forms of ways to ask the question)in a human type of form.\n",
    "- What were the top 5 shows on Netflix 2 years ago? Show me the top 5 shows on Netflix 2 years ago. Show me the top 5 shows on Netflix two years ago.\n",
    "- What was the top movie on Netflix in 2020?\n",
    "- How long was the best movie on Netflix last year? What was the release year of that movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just *sample* questions. You need to allow you bot to ask 10 different categories/types of questions. They are up to you on which questions, but the bot needs to tell the user what those question categories that it can answer. Like: Top movies by year, top X movies / shows by year. Genre of Movie/Show of the top Movie/Show...# of seasons of top shows...etc. Star(s) of the top show/movie. You’ll need to use the user response to form a query for your Mongo Dataset."

    "1. Create Questions that people can ask the chatbox:\n",
    "    - *Question 1*: Ask for the highest rated movie for this year\n",
    "    - *Question 2*: Ask for the most popular movie for this year\n",
    "    - *Question 3*: Ask for the highest rated show for this year\n",
    "    - *Question 4*: Ask for the most popular show for this year\n",
    "    - *Question 5*: Ask for where the movie was produced (provide movie title)\n",
    "    - *Question 6*: Ask for movie genre (provide movie title)\n",
    "    - *Question 7*: Ask for movie runtime (provide movie title)\n",
    "    - *Question 8*: Ask for show runtime (provide show title)\n",
    "    - *Question 9*: Ask for what characters the actor has played (provide actor name)\n",
    "    - *Question 10*: Ask for movie age certification/rating (provide movie title)\n",
    "2. Extract unique data for the answer to each question\n",
    "3. Load each dataframe into a mongodb with each collection named after the question number\n",
    "4. Create intents file and follow tensorflow <i>tag, patterns, responses, context_set</i> format\n",
    "5. Train model in tensorflow to identify questions and responses\n",
    "6. Create chat function to find prediction from tensorflow and query data based on tag and provide acceptable response "
